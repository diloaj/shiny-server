","The Kenya Government plans to establish a National Safety Net Program (NSNP) that will provide a coordinated and harmonized framework for the five main cash transfer programs: the Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children; the cash transfer for Persons with Severe Disabilities; the Older Person’s Cash Transfer; the Urban Food Subsidy Cash Transfer; and the Hunger Safety Net Program. The Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Development (MGCSD) manages the cash transfer for Persons with Severe Disabilities. Programs with their current resource levels are largely limited in coverage. For instance, in some locations, only four to eight PWSD are benefitting from the program, which leaves out a large pool of people who qualify for support. To ensure that only the most deserving people are supported, the PWSD-CT program involves disability groups in the targeting process on the assumption that the members know each other and are able to identify those most in need among them. However, some of the community members claimed that favouritism had determined the selection of PWSD-CT beneficiaries. It may also be the case that some community members who choose to hide their disability are being left out of the program (Amuyunzu-Nyamongo, 2013).","Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Development (2013, 2011).
